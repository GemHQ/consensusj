WARNING: Do not use this software with your Bitcoin private keys without doing a rigorous audit of the code. (Feedback welcome.)

WARNING: The API is not final and *may* change without warning (we try to deprecate first).

We're hoping that one or more modules will be accepted into the bitcoinj project. Most of these components are fairly new, but all are useful and ready for pull requests.

[#bitcoinj-cli]
==== bitcoinj-cli: An Bitcoin RPC command-line client

An alternative implementation of `bitcoin-cli` in Java. Built as a fat jar executable with `java -jar`. The command:

[subs="attributes"]
    java -jar bitcoinj-cli-{consensusj-version}.jar -rpcport=8080 getblockcount

will output:

    Connecting to: http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    0

NOTE: Only a few RPCs are currently supported. Pull requests welcome.

For help type:

[subs="attributes"]
    java -jar bitcoinj-cli-{consensusj-version}.jar -?

or read the http://msgilligan.github.io/bitcoinj-addons/manpage-bitcoinj-cli.html[manual page].

[#bitcoinj-rpcclient]
==== bitcoinj-rpcclient: A Bitcoin JSON-RPC client using bitcoinj types

If the RPC procedure takes a Bitcoin address as parameter, then the Java method will take an `org.bitcoinj.core.Address`.
If the RPC returns a transaction, the Java method will return an `org.bitcoinj.core.Transaction`.

See the JavaDoc for http://msgilligan.github.io/bitcoinj-addons/apidoc/com/msgilligan/bitcoinj/rpc/BitcoinClient.html[BitcoinClient] to see the methods implemented.

===== Sample Spock Integration Tests

These sample Spock "feature tests" show the RPC client in action and are from the file https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons/blob/master/bitcoinj-rpcclient/src/integ/groovy/com/msgilligan/bitcoinj/rpc/BitcoinSpec.groovy#L31-L55[BitcoinSpec.groovy].

[source,groovy]
----
    def "Use RegTest mode to generate a block upon request"() {
        given: "a certain starting height"
        def startHeight = blockCount

        when: "we generate 1 new block"
        generateBlock()

        then: "the block height is 1 higher"
        blockCount == startHeight + 1
    }

    def "When we send an amount to a newly created address, it arrives"() {
        given: "A new, empty Bitcoin address"
        def destinationAddress = getNewAddress()

        when: "we send it testAmount (from coins mined in RegTest mode)"
        sendToAddress(destinationAddress, testAmount, "comment", "comment-to")

        and: "we generate 1 new block"
        generateBlock()
 
        then: "the new address has a balance of testAmount"
        testAmount == getReceivedByAddress(destinationAddress)
    }
----


[#bitcoinj-json]
==== bitcoinj-json

http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson] serializers, deserializers & POJOs used to create and parse JSON by both client and server implementations of Bitcoin JSON-RPC.

[#bitcoinj-server]
==== bitcoinj-server

Service objects that power the Daemon and PeerServer. Some objects, such as http://msgilligan.github.io/bitcoinj-addons/apidoc/com/msgilligan/bitcoinj/spring/service/PeerGroupService.html[PeerGroupService], rely solely on http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/annotation/package-summary.html[javax.annotation] and https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/package-summary.html[javax.inject] for configuration and can be wired with either Spring or (in theory)  https://github.com/google/guice[Guice]. The current focus is on http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot], but we're hoping to build a http://ratpack.io[Ratpack] server in the future.

[#bitcoinj-daemon]
==== bitcoinj-daemon

A starting point for building a complete `bitcoind` equivalent using **bitcoinj**. Currently serves a very https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons/blob/master/bitcoinj-json/src/main/java/com/msgilligan/bitcoinj/rpcserver/BitcoinJsonRpc.java[small subset] of the https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs[Bitcoin RPC API] (Bitcoin uses http://www.jsonrpc.org[JSON-RPC].)

Uses a `PeerGroup` to power the limited RPCs. Will use a `BlockStore`. (Pull requests welcome.)

Built as a fat, executable jar, so it can be run with `java -jar`.

[#bitcoinj-peerserver]
==== bitcoinj-peerserver

PeerServer is a bitcoinj-powered http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] application that provides the following functions:

. A *Bitcoin JSON-RPC service* at `http://[host]:[port]/bitcoinrpc`
.. This is hard to connect to using `bitcoin-cli` as it expects the RPCs to be accessible at the root path ('/'), but you can use the Java RPC client or CLI tool to talk to it.
.. There may be issues with the security configuration on this URL. We're currently investigating.

. A https://stomp.github.io[STOMP protocol] *WebSocket* service that live-streams pending Bitcoin transactions from the P2P network.
.. The page at `/peers.html` lists connected peers and streams Transactions from the P2P network.
.. You must login using username: `admin`, password: `admin` to view this page.
.. The `peers.html' page is currently unstyled HTML.

No `bitcoind` is required. The server uses a bitcoinj https://bitcoinj.github.io/javadoc/{bitcoinj-version}/org/bitcoinj/core/PeerGroup.html[PeerGroup] to connect directly to the Bitcoin network. I'm considering renaming it to `PeerGroupServer` for this reason. The JAR is entirely self-contained and can be run on any system with Java 8 with the `java -jar peerserver-{consensusj-version}.jar` command.

[#bitcoinj-proxy]
==== bitcoinj-proxy

A https://ratpack.io[Ratpack]-based proxy server that can proxy JSON-RPC commands to a connected *bitcoind* (or *Omni Core*) server. It can also be used as a starting point for JSON-RPC interoperable microservices.

[#bitcoinj-money]
==== bitcoinj-money

http://javamoney.github.io[JavaMoney] (also known as http://javamoney.github.io/api.html[JSR 354]) is the new Java Standard for advanced and flexible currency handling on the Java platform.

[quote, JavaMoney Web Site]
JSR 354 provides a portable and extendible framework for handling of Money & Currency. The API models monetary amounts and currencies in a platform independent and portable way, including well defined extension points.

Support for virtual currencies is one of the key design goals in the specification. The `bitcoinj-money` module will allow Bitcoin to
 be used by standard Java APIs in the same ways as fiat currencies.

The JavaMoney Reference Implementation (aka "Moneta") contains implementations of `ExchangeRateProvider` for ECB (European Central Bank) and IMF (International Monetary Fund).
 There is also U.S. FRB (Federal Reserve Bank) and Yahoo Finance `ExchangeRateProvider` in the JavaMoney financial library add-on module.

`bitcoinj-money` contains `BitcoinCurrencyProvider` which will add `"BTC"` as a standard currency code to any applications including the `bitcoinj-money` JAR in its classpath. and `"BTC"` will be available to your applications.

The `bitcoinj-money` module also includes an adapter class `BaseXChangeExchangeRateProvider` that along with a 1-line subclass adapts implementations of the `Exchange` interface in the popular and complete http://knowm.org/open-source/xchange/[XChange] library to be used by JavaMoney-compatible applications.


[#bitcoinj-dsl]
==== bitcoinj-dsl

Groovy DSL support to write things like:

    assert 1.btc == 100_000_000.satoshi

 and

    assert 100.satoshi == Coin.MICROCOIN

[#bitcoinj-spock]
=== bitcoinj-spock

https://github.com/spockframework/spock/blob/master/README.md[Spock] tests of **bitcoinj** classes. Initial focus is learning and documentation, not test coverage.
